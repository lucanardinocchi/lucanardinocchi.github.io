        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>
            I'm a 21 year old, living in Sydney by myself, trying to make it in the world one thought at a time. I study aerospace engineering and philosophy at the University of Sydney.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I try to read as much as possible as often as possible. I try to meet as many people in as many different situations as I can manage. And I listen to music, so much music. Ideas fuel me; creating them, interrogating them, realising them, and reflecting on them drive me to keep thinking and dreaming, and to keep pushing forward.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I want to do the best work with the best people. Actively learning in the venture capital space (tech + people + society!).
